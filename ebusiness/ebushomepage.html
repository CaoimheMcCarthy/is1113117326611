            <h2>I. Software as a Service</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which applications are hosted by a vendor  
            and made available to customers over a network, usually the internet as we are using. 
            It differs from traditional software in the that it is not purchased and loaded onto a device, rather
            SaaS operates as a subscription service, to which customers can pay a periodical fee while they require the service,
            and simply cancel it when the software becomes redundant to them.</p>
            <p><strong>An example of Software as a Service is <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/eu/?ir=1">Salesforce</a></strong>, the worldâ€™s #1 Customer 
            Relationship Management (CRM) platform, comprising of cloud-based applications for sales, service and marketing.</p>

            <h2>II. Platform as a Service</h2></div>
            <p>Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud computing model in which we as the third-party provider deliver hardware and software tools
            for application development to users by means of the internet. As a PaaS provider we host the hardware and 
            software on our own infrastructure. As a result, PaaS frees users from having to install in-house hardware and software to develop or 
            run a new application.</p>
            <p>PaaS comprises of three main components that come together to streamline the deployment process whilst providing users with the best technology
            and the resources to keep their application running at it's peak all the time.</p>
            <h4>The Stack: </h4><p>These are the various libraries, frameworks, and services that the developer uses to build the application and which are 
            assumed to be present in the runtime environment. The stack consists of components such as the language interpreter or language, the application 
            framework and the HTTP server</p>
            <h4>The Deployment Machinery: </h4><p>This instantiates virtual servers and provisions them with instances of the stack and the application code. The machinery
            itself is also code that runs once the deploy command has been enabled and stops once the application is up and fully functional.</p>
            <h4>User Interface:</h4><p>This is the Graphical User Interface with which the user interacts with during development. We provide platforms with optimal usability and learnability 
            in order to facilitate our users to develop on our platforms easily and quickly.</p>
            <p><strong>An example of a Platform as a Service is <a href="https://c9.io/login">Cloud 9</a></strong>, a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets 
            you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser.</p>

            <h2>III. Infrastructure as a Service</h2></div>
            <p>Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) involves the provision of virtualised computing resources over the internet. We, as the cloud provider, fill the position of the traditional
            on-site data centre, providing servers, storage and networking hardware. The use of IaaS brings great cost benefits for a business and individuals as it eliminates the burden of buying,
            managing and supporting the infrastructure themselves.</p>
            <p><strong>An example of Infrastructure as a Service is <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">Amazon Web Services</a></strong>, a secure cloud services platform, offering compute power, database storage, 
            content delivery and other functionality to help businesses scale and grow.</p>

            <h2>IV. Communication as a Service</h2></div>
            <p>Communication as a Service (CaaS) is a means of outsourcing enterprise communications, that can be leased in it's entirety from us as the vendor.
            Our CaaS includes resources such as Voice over IP, Instant Messaging, and video-conferencing applications.
            CaaS offers flexibility and expandability that small and medium-sized business might not otherwise afford, allowing for the addition of devices, 
            modes or coverage on demand. The network capacity and feature set can be changed from day to day if necessary so that functionality keeps pace with
            demand and resources are not wasted. There is no risk of the system becoming obsolete and requiring periodic major upgrades or replacement.</p>
            <p><strong>An example of Communication as a Service is <a href="https://www.google.com/gmail/">Gmail</a></strong>, an easy to use email app that saves you time and keeps your messages safe.
            Get your messages instantly via push notifications, read and respond online & offline, and find any message quickly.</p>
